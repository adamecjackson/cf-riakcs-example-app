# Riak CS Example App

This app is an example of how you can consume a Cloud Foundry service within an app.

It allows you to write and read data in the form of key:value pairs to a Riak CS bucket using RESTful endpoints.

### Getting Started

Install the app by pushing it to your Cloud Foundry and binding with the Riak CS service

Example:

    $ tar -xvf riakcs-example-app.tgz
    $ cd riakcs-example-app
    $ cf push riakcs-example-app -c 'bundle exec ruby main.rb -p $PORT'
    $ cf create-service p-riakcs developer mybucket
    $ cf bind-service riakcs-example-app mybucket
    $ cf restart riakcs-example-app

### Endpoints

#### PUT /:key

Stores the key:value pair in the Riak CS bucket. Example:

    $ curl -X POST riakcs-example-app.my-cloud-foundry.com/service/blobstore/mybucket/foo -d 'bar'
    success


#### GET /:key

Returns the value stored in the Riak CS bucket for a specified key. Example:

    $ curl -X GET riakcs-example-app.my-cloud-foundry.com/service/blobstore/mybucket/foo
    bar

#### DELETE /:key

Deletes the bucket. Example:

    $ curl -X DELETE riakcs-example-app.my-cloud-foundry.com/service/blobstore/mybucket
    success

Once you've deleted your bucket, you should unbind and delete the service instance, as these are references in Cloud Foundry to an instance which no longer exists.

    $ cf unbind-service riakcs-example-app mybucket
    $ cf delete-service mybucket
    $ cf restart riakcs-example-app
